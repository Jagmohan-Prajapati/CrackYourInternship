"""Given an adjacency list of a graph adj of V no. of vertices having 0 based index. Check whether the graph is bipartite or not.

Know more about Bipartite Graph: - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bipartite-graph/

Example 1:

Input: 

Output: 1
Explanation: The given graph can be colored 
in two colors so, it is a bipartite graph.
Example 2:

Input:

Output: 0
Explanation: The given graph cannot be colored 
in two colors such that color of adjacent 
vertices differs. 
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isBipartite() which takes V denoting no. of vertices and adj denoting adjacency list of the graph and returns a boolean value true if the graph is bipartite otherwise returns false.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Space Complexity: O(V)

Constraints:
1 ≤ V, E ≤ 105"""
